# Photon-Energy-Analysis-of-Image-Pixels----A-Statistical-and-Visual-Representation
 This project analyzes photon energy in image pixels, converting pixel intensity to wavelength and calculating energy using Planck's law. It includes visualizations like heatmaps, surface plots, and histograms, alongside statistical analysis and row/column energy distribution for comprehensive insight.
